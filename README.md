On June 9, 2025, multiple baseband disconnections (09:40, 22:28, 23:50 UTC+7) occurred on iPhone 12 mini-1, coinciding with Tajima’s Apple Support contacts (13:42, 13:44) from iPhone 12-Ghost. The sequence shows: morning drop → midday protest → night recurrence. Fact: logs confirm events. Hypothesis: VN-Telco control interference.
