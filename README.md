On June 9, 2025, multiple baseband disconnections (09:40, 22:28, 23:50 UTC+7) occurred on iPhone 12 mini-1, coinciding with Tajima’s Apple Support contacts (13:42, 13:44) from iPhone 12-Ghost. The sequence shows: morning drop → midday protest → night recurrence. Fact: logs confirm events. Hypothesis: VN-Telco control interference.
On June 9, 2025, abnormal network disconnections were logged in baseband records of iPhone 12 mini-1 at 09:40, 22:28, and 23:50 (UTC+7). On the same day, Apple Support was contacted from iPhone 12-Ghost at 13:42 and 13:44, reporting account misuse and remote control. The documented timeline demonstrates a three-part sequence: morning drop, midday complaint, and night recurrence. Facts: timestamps and logs are verified, chain-of-custody preserved via hashes and CSVs. Hypothesis: the recurrence after user escalation suggests targeted interference, possibly linked to VN-Telco operations. Severity ranges Medium to High, with human impact recorded as communication loss and perception of forced remote control.
